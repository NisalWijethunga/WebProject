Because  They Are Helping To Maintain The Health Of Marine Ecosystem And Provide Support To Other Marine Life. They Are An  Important Part Of The Food Web.

About 80 Million Tons Of Fish Are Harvested Annually .This Volume Is Enough To Feed All Filipinos With Their Annual Fish Consumption For 20 Years .And They Are Currently About 60 Million People Working In The Fishing Industry Globally.
