                    <h2>WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?</h2>
                    <p>Because of the highly touristic exposure,
                            insensitive tourist development and negative interaction with 
                            the coastline by the locals such as 
                            adding toxic materials and harmful pollutants has led directly 
                            to the destruction of vital eco-system and coastal area.
                            So, we need to protect both costal and
                            life below water because thousands of lives are depend on it.

                            <p>One of the greatest threats to our oceans is marine pollution (also known as man-made pollution). 
                               It's a combination of chemicals and trash, mostly from land, 
                               such as discarded plastic and other residential waste, and 
                               industrial chemicals that are washed or blown into the ocean, 
                               with devastating consequences for marine life and the habitats on which they depend.
