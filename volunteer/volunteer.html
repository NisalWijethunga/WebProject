                            adding toxic materials and harmful pollutants has led directly 
                            to the destruction of vital eco-system and coastal area.
                            So, we need to protect both costal and
                            life below water because thousands of lives are depend on it.

                            <p>One of the greatest threats to our oceans is marine pollution (also known as man-made pollution). 
                               It's a combination of chemicals and trash, mostly from land, 
                               such as discarded plastic and other residential waste, and 
                               industrial chemicals that are washed or blown into the ocean, 
                               with devastating consequences for marine life and the habitats on which they depend.

                            <p>
                              Nowadays, coastal areas and marine life habitats are at great risk from human activities 
                              such as illegal fishing, construction, overpopulation, and tourism.Illegal construction and overfishing
                              could affect coastal biodiversity and lead to the extinction of endangered species.
                             marine pollution leads to the destruction of coastal areas and marine life such as corals and turtles.
